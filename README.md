## üéØ Character Evaluation System

The character evaluation system is the core of Mudae AutoClaimer's intelligence. It analyzes characters based on multiple factors to determine which ones are worth claiming.

### Evaluation Process

1. **Character Detection**:
   - Monitors Mudae embeds for character information
   - Extracts name, series, and kakera value
   - Identifies whether the character is already claimed

2. **Value Assessment**:
   - Base value from kakera amount in footer
   - Wishlist bonus applied to desired characters
   - Special bonuses for rare Pokemon
   - Rarity detection for legendary/mythical Pokemon

3. **Decision Making**:
   - Compares character value against minimum threshold
   - Prioritizes characters based on total calculated value
   - Considers wishlist status as a priority factor
   - Makes claiming decisions based on the highest value character

### Customizing Evaluation

You can customize how characters are evaluated by adjusting:

- `MIN_KAKERA`: Base threshold for consideration
- `WISHED_BONUS`: Extra value for wishlist characters
- `RARE_POKEMON_BONUS`: Extra value for rare Pokemon
- `wishlist.txt`: Characters to prioritize
- `rare_pokemon.txt`: Pokemon to prioritize

### Anti-Snipe Protection

The anti-snipe system protects valuable characters from being claimed by others:

1. Monitors chat for claiming attempts by other users
2. Immediately triggers emergency claim protocol when detected
3. Claims the best available character before it can be sniped
4. Bypasses normal waiting periods in emergency situations

<hr>

## üéÆ Pokemon System

The Pokemon system provides specialized handling for Pokemon characters rolled with the `$p` command.

### Pokemon Mode Features

- **Dedicated Rolling**: Separate roll command and schedule for Pokemon
- **Enhanced Recognition**: Detects Pokemon series and rarity levels
- **Special Valuation**: Applies bonus values to rare and legendary Pokemon
- **Optimized Timing**: Configurable intervals for Pokemon-specific rolling
- **Collection Tracking**: Specialized statistics for Pokemon collection

### Pokemon Detection Logic

The script detects Pokemon using multiple methods:

1. **Series Detection**:
   - Identifies "Pokemon" in the series name
   - Recognizes Pokemon-specific formatting in embeds

2. **Rarity Classification**:
   - Identifies legendary Pokemon from description
   - Detects mythical Pokemon from description
   - Matches against custom rare Pokemon list

3. **Value Calculation**:
   - Base kakera value from the embed
   - Bonus value for rare Pokemon list matches
   - Rarity bonuses for legendary/mythical status

### Pokemon Configuration

Customize the Pokemon system with these settings:

- `ENABLE_POKEMON_MODE`: Toggle the entire Pokemon system
- `POKEMON_INTERVAL`: How often to run Pokemon roll sessions
- `POKEMON_MIN_KAKERA`: Threshold for claiming Pokemon
- `POKEMON_ROLLS`: Number of rolls per Pokemon session
- `RARE_POKEMON_BONUS`: Value bonus for rare Pokemon
- `RARE_POKEMON`: List of valuable Pokemon to prioritize

### Pokemon Commands

- `!pokemonmode`: Toggle Pokemon mode on/off
- `!rollpokemon`: Execute an immediate Pokemon roll session
- `!pokemonlist`: View your rare Pokemon list
- `!pokemonlist add POKEMON`: Add a Pokemon to your rare list
- `!pokestats`: View Pokemon-specific statistics

<hr>

## üïµÔ∏è Stealth System

The stealth system is designed to make the bot's behavior appear more human-like and reduce the risk of detection.

### Stealth Features

- **Random Timing**: Variable delays between actions
- **Activity Simulation**: Occasional skipped rolls and varied patterns
- **Time-Based Adjustments**: Different behavior based on time of day
- **Daily Limits**: Maximum daily roll caps to avoid suspicious activity

## üìä Statistics & Analytics

The statistics system tracks your Mudae collection progress and provides detailed analytics.

### Tracked Metrics

- **Total Claims**: Number of characters successfully claimed
- **Total Kakera**: Amount of kakera earned from claims
- **Wish Claims**: Number of wishlist characters claimed
- **Daily Metrics**: Claims and kakera per day
- **Character Frequency**: Most frequently claimed characters
- **Value Leaders**: Highest kakera value characters
- **Pokemon Stats**: Dedicated Pokemon claiming statistics
- **Session Data**: Performance within active rolling sessions

### Statistics Commands

- `!stats`: View comprehensive claim statistics and graph
- `!kakstats`: View top kakera value characters
- `!pokestats`: View Pokemon-specific statistics
- `!resetstats`: Reset all statistics (with backup)
- `!exportstats`: Export statistics to CSV file

### Data Storage

Statistics are stored in the `claimed_characters.json` file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "claims": [
    {
      "name": "Character Name",
      "value": 1250,
      "timestamp": "2023-10-25T15:30:45.123456",
      "is_wished": true,
      "series": "Series Name"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "total": 42,
  "by_name": {
    "Character Name": 3,
    ...
  },
  "by_day": {
    "2023-10-25": {
      "count": 15,
      "kakera": 12500,
      "wish_count": 3
    },
    ...
  },
  "kakera_total": 45000,
  "wish_claims": 8
}
```

### Visual Analytics

The `!stats` command generates visual graphs showing:

1. Daily claims over time (including wish claims)
2. Daily kakera earnings over time

These graphs help visualize your collection progress and identify trends in your claiming patterns.

### Data Export

The `!exportstats` command exports your statistics to a CSV file (`mudae_stats.csv`) with the following columns:

- Character Name
- Kakera Value
- Claim Date
- Wishlist Status
- Pokemon Status

This allows for external analysis in spreadsheet applications.

   - Ensure thresholds match your server's economy

3. **Test Manually**:
   - Use `!rollnow` to test immediate rolls
   - Use `!status` to check if the channel is active
   - Watch the bot's reactions to see if claiming works

4. **Reset if Necessary**:
   - Stop the bot with `!stoproll`
   - Restart the script
   - Set up the channel again with `!setrollhere`

## üîÑ Maintenance & Best Practices

### Regular Maintenance

- **Backup Statistics**: Regularly back up your `claimed_characters.json` file
- **Update Wishlist**: Keep your wishlist updated with desired characters
- **Monitor Performance**: Check statistics periodically to ensure optimal claiming
- **Adjust Settings**: Fine-tune configuration based on results
- **Update Script**: Check for script updates to address any Mudae changes

### Optimal Settings

- **Roll Interval**: 120-180 seconds is a good balance
- **Min Kakera**: Set based on your server's average (typically 400-600)
- **Wishlist Bonus**: 250-400 provides good prioritization
- **Roll Amount**: 8-12 characters per batch is optimal
- **Stealth Level**: 3-4 for regular use, 5 for high-security needs

### Best Practices

1. **Stay Under the Radar**:
   - Use stealth features consistently
   - Don't run 24/7 without breaks
   - Set reasonable daily limits
   - Vary your activity patterns

2. **Optimize Your Wishlist**:
   - Add high-value characters you want
   - Keep wishlist focused (50-200 characters)
   - Update as you claim wished characters

3. **Server Consideration**:
   - Be aware of server rules about automation
   - Consider using lower roll frequency in active servers
   - Avoid using in servers that actively monitor for bots

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Regular exports of statistics
   - Periodic script restarts
   - Adjust thresholds based on server economy
   - Monitor system resource usage

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is this against Discord's Terms of Service?**  
A: Yes, self-bots violate Discord's ToS. This script is provided for educational purposes only, and usage is at your own risk.

**Q: How many characters can I expect to claim per day?**  
A: With default settings and average luck, approximately 5-15 characters per day depending on server activity and kakera values.

**Q: Will this get my account banned?**  
A: There is always a risk when using automation tools. Using stealth features reduces risk, but cannot eliminate it entirely.

**Q: Can I run this 24/7?**  
A: While technically possible, it's not recommended. Using scheduled breaks and quiet hours creates more natural patterns.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Which claim emoji should I use?**  
A: Check your server's Mudae settings with `$setautomark`. Common options are "‚ù§Ô∏è", "üíñ", "üíù", "üíû", and "‚ô•Ô∏è".

**Q: How do I find the right MIN_KAKERA value?**  
A: Monitor characters in your server for a day, noting their kakera values. Set the threshold slightly below the average of characters you want.

**Q: Can I use this on multiple servers?**  
A: Yes, but you should run separate instances with configurations tailored to each server.

**Q: Does this work with custom Mudae prefixes?**  
A: Yes, update the `PREFIX` setting in the configuration to match your server's prefix.

### Feature Questions

**Q: Can I prioritize certain series over others?**  
A: Not directly, but you can add all characters from your favorite series to the wishlist.

**Q: Will this claim characters I already own?**  
A: No, the script detects and skips already claimed characters.

**Q: Can I use custom reaction emojis for claiming?**  
A: Yes, update the `CLAIM_EMOJI` setting to match your server's custom emoji.

**Q: How does the anti-snipe system work?**
