## üìñ Introduction

Mudae AutoClaimer is a sophisticated automation tool for Discord's Mudae bot. It handles character rolling, intelligent claiming based on kakera value, and provides comprehensive statistics tracking. The script includes specialized support for Pokemon rolls, wishlist prioritization, and advanced stealth features to mimic human behavior.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### ü§ñ Core Automation System
- **Automatic Rolling**: Schedules and performs rolls at customizable intervals
- **Smart Claiming**: Evaluates characters based on kakera value and wishlist status
- **Command Rotation**: Intelligently rotates between `$wa`, `$wg`, `$mx`, and `$p` commands
- **Batch Processing**: Evaluates groups of characters before making optimal claim decisions
- **Anti-Snipe Protection**: Defensive protocol when others attempt to claim rare characters
- **Daily Command Automation**: Automatically executes `$daily`, `$dk`, and `$vote` commands

### üéÆ Pokemon Integration
- **Dedicated Pokemon Mode**: Specialized rolling with the `$p` command
- **Rare Pokemon Detection**: Automatically identifies and prioritizes legendary/mythical Pokemon
- **Pokemon-Specific Valuation**: Applies bonus values to rare Pokemon species
- **Separate Roll Sessions**: Independent Pokemon rolling schedule from regular characters
- **Pokemon Statistics Tracking**: Dedicated statistics for Pokemon collection

### üìä Advanced Statistics
- **Claim Tracking**: Records all successful claims with timestamps and values
- **Visual Graphs**: Generates charts of daily claims and kakera earnings
- **Character Leaderboards**: Tracks most frequently claimed characters
- **Value Leaderboards**: Ranks characters by kakera value
- **Data Export**: Exports statistics to CSV format for external analysis
- **Session Statistics**: Tracks performance within active rolling sessions

### üïµÔ∏è Stealth System
- **Human-Like Timing**: Randomized delays between actions to appear more natural
- **Activity Simulation**: Occasionally skips rolls to mimic human behavior patterns
- **Time-Based Adjustments**: Varies roll frequency based on time of day
- **Daily Limits**: Configurable maximum daily rolls to avoid detection
- **Quiet Hours**: Automatically pauses during specified hours
- **Tiered Protection**: 5 levels of stealth with increasing security measures

## üì• Installation & Setup

1. **Install Requirements**:
   ```
   pip install nighty matplotlib
   ```

2. **Download the Script**:
   - Save `MudaeAutoClaimer.py` to your project directory

3. **Create Support Files** (Optional):
   - `wishlist.txt`: One character name per line to prioritize
   - `rare_pokemon.txt`: Additional rare Pokemon names to prioritize

4. **Set Claim Emoji**:
   - Verify the `CLAIM_EMOJI` in the config is set to the correct claim emoji (default is "‚ù§Ô∏è")
   - This must match the emoji your server uses for claiming characters
   - Common alternatives include "üíñ", "üíù", "üíû" or other heart variations

5. **Start the Script**:
   ```
   python MudaeAutoClaimer.py
   ```

6. **Initial Configuration**:
   - In Discord, navigate to your desired roll channel
   - Type `!setrollhere` to activate the auto-roller

## üìä Statistics System

The statistics system tracks:

- **Total Claims**: Number of characters successfully claimed
- **Total Kakera**: Amount of kakera earned from all claims
- **Wish Claims**: Number of wishlist characters claimed
- **Daily Performance**: Claims and kakera per day
- **Character Frequency**: Most frequently claimed characters
- **Value Leaders**: Highest kakera value characters
- **Pokemon Stats**: Dedicated Pokemon claiming statistics

Statistics are saved to `claimed_characters.json` and automatically backed up.

## üìà Performance Optimization

For best results:

- Set `MIN_KAKERA` appropriate to your server (400-500 recommended)
- Enable `ACTIVITY_SIMULATION` and `ADVANCED_TIMING` for better stealth
- Set reasonable daily limits with `MAX_DAILY_ROLLS` (150-200 recommended)
- Configure `DISABLE_DURING_HOURS` to pause during suspicious times
- Add your most wanted characters to the wishlist file
- Add valuable Pokemon to the rare Pokemon list

## üîç Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Characters not being claimed | ‚Ä¢ Check `MIN_KAKERA` threshold<br>‚Ä¢ **Verify `CLAIM_EMOJI` matches your server's claim emoji**<br>‚Ä¢ Confirm the bot has permission to add reactions |
| Wrong emoji being used | ‚Ä¢ Change the `CLAIM_EMOJI` in CONFIG to match your server's claim emoji<br>‚Ä¢ Common options: "‚ù§Ô∏è", "üíñ", "üíù", "üíû", "‚ô•Ô∏è" |
| No rolls happening | ‚Ä¢ Verify channel is set with `!setrollhere`<br>‚Ä¢ Check `ROLL_INTERVAL` setting |
| Script crashes | ‚Ä¢ Check console for error messages<br>‚Ä¢ Verify Mudae's embed format hasn't changed |
| Poor character selection | ‚Ä¢ Add important characters to wishlist.txt for higher priority |
| Pokemon not being recognized | ‚Ä¢ Ensure `ENABLE_POKEMON_MODE` is set to True |
| Detection concerns | ‚Ä¢ Increase stealth level with `!stealth 4` or `!stealth 5` |

## üîÑ Maintenance

- Back up your `claimed_characters.json` regularly
- Check for Mudae UI changes that might affect character detection
- Update your wishlist and rare Pokemon list as needed
- Use `!exportstats` periodically to back up your data
- Monitor console output for any warnings or errors
