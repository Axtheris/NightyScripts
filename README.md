## üîç Troubleshooting

- If claims aren't working, verify your `MIN_KAKERA` setting
- If the bot isn't detecting characters, ensure Mudae's embed format hasn't changed
- Use `!status` to check if the bot is active and properly configured
- Review console output for any error messages

## üìä Statistics

The script automatically tracks:
- Total claims and kakera earned
- Wish claims and Pokemon claims
- Daily performance metrics
- Top claimed characters
- Top kakera value characters

Use `!stats`, `!kakstats`, and `!pokestats` to view your statistics.
